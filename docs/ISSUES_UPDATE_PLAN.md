## Notes for Implementation

1. **Always test on M3 Max** - Performance characteristics differ from x86/CUDA
2. **Use feature flags** - Allow gradual rollout of streaming features
3. **Document M3-specific setup** - Many developers won't have Apple Silicon experience
4. **Monitor thermals** - Though unlikely issue with M3 Max
5. **Test battery performance** - Ensure efficiency on battery power

## Communication Template for Team

```markdown
Subject: AI Assistant Roadmap Update - Streaming Implementation with M3 Optimization

Team,

We're restructuring our roadmap to implement real-time streaming with XTTS v2, optimized for Apple Silicon M3 Max hardware. This will achieve <200ms voice-to-voice latency.

Key Changes:
- Closing 6 completed/obsolete issues
- Updating 3 major issues with streaming scope
- Creating 3 new issues for M3 optimization and voice cloning
- Prioritizing into 3 weekly sprints

Please review the updated issues and claim any you'd like to work on.

Target: Fully operational streaming assistant by end of Week 3.
